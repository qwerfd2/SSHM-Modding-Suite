# SSHM-Modding-Suite

These are two scripts that can extract and convert the content of ```.pak``` files for The Secret Society - Hidden Mystery, and another script that can decrypt the ```player.prf``` save file.

---

**extract.py**: Extract ```.pak``` file(s).

 - Extract every ```.pak``` file under the same directory: ```python extract.py all output_dir```

 - Extract a single ```.pak``` file under the same directory: ```python extract.py pack.pak output_dir```

Files will be extracted to "output_dir" folder.

---

**decode.py**: Convert ```.jpg``` and associated mask file to ```.png```.

 - Convert all .jpg files under a directory: ```python decode.py input_dir```
 
```.jpg``` files will be removed once the converted ```.png``` is saved. Might take a long time due to the pixel-by-pixel conversion.

---

**decrypt.py**: Decrypt save file ```player.prf``` under the same directory.

Make sure ```player.prf``` is within the same directory as the script, then call ```python decrypt.py```

plaintext file will be saved to ```edited.prf```. 

Encrypt is currently unnecessary as the game reads plaintext just fine, but the script should work for encrypt after with minor modification.
