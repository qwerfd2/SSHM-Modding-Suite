# SSHM-Pak-Extractor

This script can extract .pak files for The Secret Society - Hidden Mystery.

Usage: ```python script.py pack.pak output_dir```

File will be saved to "output_dir" folder.

Dependencies: Python 3, obviously, but nothing else in particular. I could make a progress bar but... eh...
